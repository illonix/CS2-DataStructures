# CS2-DataStructures
This repository contains projects and exercises from my CS2 class, focusing on Data Structures and Abstraction. It includes implementations of common data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. The goal is to deepen understanding of how data is organized, manipulated, and optimized in computer science.
